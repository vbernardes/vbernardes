For this project, I analyzed a data set containing information about [Prosper](https://www.prosper.com) loans in search of impactful insights that could lead to an engaging visualization. After the analysis, one important insight was uncovered: The Prosper ranking mislabeled some high-risk loans as low-risk, potentially misleading investors.

Please check out more details, different versions of the visualization, the reasoning behind the design and the code on the [project page](https://vbernardes.github.io/udacity-dataviz-proj/).
