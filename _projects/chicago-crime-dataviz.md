For this project, we explored a data set about crimes in the city of Chicago in order to uncover insights and answer four different questions:

* Does education influence the number of crimes?
* What type of crimes happens more often near schools? And there is a difference between public and private schools?
* What types of socioeconomic factors influence the amount and types of crimes?
* How effective are gun restriction laws in reducing crime?

Please check out more details, the visualizations, the reasoning behind the design and the code on the [project page](https://vbernardes.github.io/chicago-crime-dataviz/).
