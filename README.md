# My personal website

My personal website, using GitHub Pages &amp; the Minimal Mistakes theme. My main goal currently is to showcase projects I have worked on.

## Structure

I am using `pages` as the main content container.

Different projects will be showcased in the `projects` collection. The `Projects` page itself is a grid listing of all the projects on that collection.
